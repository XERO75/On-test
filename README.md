# On WeChat Mini Program Demo Project

Welcome to the GitHub repository of the WeChat Mini Program demo project! This project is developed using the native TypeScript approach, aiming to showcase some basic features of WeChat Mini Program along with performance optimization techniques. The main functionalities include the PDP (Product Detail Page) and a rich text editor.

## Key Features

- **PDP Page**: Displays the product detail page, including product name, price, description, and other information.
- **Rich Text Editor**: Provides users with the ability to edit rich text, supporting formatting text, inserting images, and more.

## Technical Highlights

This project adopts several performance optimization measures to enhance the loading speed and user experience of the Mini Program:

- **Mini Program Sub-packages**: Divide pages and components into sub-packages according to functional modules, reducing the main package size and speeding up the Mini Program startup.
- **Using CDN Resources**: Store some common libraries, style files, and other resources on CDN to accelerate resource loading.
- **Skeleton Screens**: Use skeleton screen technology during page loading to provide a preview of the loading process, reducing user waiting time.
- **Lazy-load Images**: Employ lazy-load technology for images on the page, delaying image loading to optimize page loading speed and smoothness.
